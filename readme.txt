Requirements: AMDIS, R, R studio, R packages: Shiny, shinyFiles, DT (possibly not complete list)

Usage:  A data file must be processed by NIST AMDIS to extract the mass spectra and calculate retention index of the pyrolysates.  Pyrolysis Polymer Search (PPS) uses the *.elu output from AMDIS and creates a *.MSPEC file (combining all the spectra into one file).  The searching is done with NIST pepsearch (included in the app) using a minimum match factor of 700, retention index window of 10, a stong RI penalty (100), and a maximum number of 5 hits for each pyrolysate.  The penalty to the match factor based on RI is 0 if the query RI is within the RI window of the library RI and penalty = |query RI - library RI| * penalty rate / RI tolerance if the query RI is outside the RI window of the library RI.  The hitlist is filtered so that an individual pyrolysate only appears once.  The polymer score is calculated by the average match factor times the fraction of pyrolysates appearing in the hit list to the number of pyrolysates in the library.  The actual identity of each pyrolysate is not inferred.  Sample data *.elu files are in the ./data/ folder.  PPPS1.elu and PPPS3.elu are both mixtrues of isotatic polypropylene and polystyrene of differing amounts.  MIX1.elu is a mixture of polyethylene and isotatic polyproplyene.  MIX 2.elu is a mixture of polyethylene, polystryene, and polybutene.  The pyrolysis library in NIST format (readable with NIST MS Search) is located in the ./pepsearch/SearchLibraries/ folder.
